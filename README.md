# Scroll Spy Demo

A react project showcasing the `ScrollSpy` component. The demo is reachable at https://scroll-spy-demo.netlify.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The core implementation
source code could be found in the `src/ScrollSpy` directory.

## Design Decisions

For inspiration on usage, I looked at https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scrollspy as reference. This led to an API
that requires the user to use `section` elements with ids in order to integrate the `ScrollSpy` component with the 
rest of the page.

## Performance Considerations

## Aspirations
What would I improve if I had more time to production-ize this?

## Limitations
Here are some potential issues with my implementation:
- Issue 1
- Issue 2
- Issue 3
